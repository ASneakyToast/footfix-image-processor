# Preferences API Key Update Fix Summary

## Problem
The "Generate Alt Text" checkbox in the Batch Processing tab was not updating after the user configured their API key in preferences. Even after successfully testing the API key and clicking "Apply" or "OK", the checkbox remained greyed out.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by multiple `PreferencesManager` instances not being synchronized. When the preferences dialog saved the API key, the `BatchProcessingWidget` was using its own `PreferencesManager` instance that had already loaded the preferences file into memory and wasn't aware of the changes made by the preferences dialog.

## Solution
Modified the `refresh_alt_text_availability()` method in `batch_widget.py` to create a fresh `PreferencesManager` instance each time it's called. This ensures it always reads the latest values from disk rather than using potentially stale in-memory values.

## Changes Made

### 1. `/footfix/gui/batch_widget.py`
- Modified `refresh_alt_text_availability()` to create a fresh `PreferencesManager` instance
- This ensures the latest saved preferences are always read from disk
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. `/footfix/gui/preferences_window.py`
- Added logging to track API key saving and signal emission
- Ensured empty API keys are saved as `None` rather than empty strings
- Added verification logging to confirm API key was saved

### 3. `/footfix/utils/preferences.py`
- Added detailed logging for save/load operations
- Specifically logs alt_text preferences for debugging

### 4. `/footfix/gui/main_window.py`
- Added logging to track preferences change handling
- Improved signal connection logging

## How It Works Now

1. User opens Preferences â†’ Alt Text tab
2. User enters API key and tests it
3. User clicks "Apply" or "OK"
4. Preferences are saved to disk
5. `preferences_changed` signal is emitted
6. Main window's `on_preferences_changed()` is called
7. This calls `batch_widget.refresh_alt_text_availability()`
8. The method creates a fresh `PreferencesManager` that loads from disk
9. It finds the newly saved API key and enables the checkbox

## Testing
The fix has been tested with a comprehensive test script that verifies:
- API keys can be saved and loaded correctly
- Multiple `PreferencesManager` instances see the same data
- The checkbox properly updates when refreshed
- The fix works in the actual widget scenario

## User Experience
Now when users:
1. Configure their API key in preferences
2. Click "Apply" or "OK"
3. The "Generate Alt Text" checkbox immediately becomes enabled
4. They can check the box to enable alt text generation for their batch
