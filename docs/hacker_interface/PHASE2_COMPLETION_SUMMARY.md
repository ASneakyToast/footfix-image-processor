## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Success

### Perfect Backend Integration
Your existing architecture made this redesign **seamless**:

```

├── core/                    # ← Unchanged! Business logic intact
│   ├── processor.py         # Image processing works perfectly
│   └── batch_processor.py   # Ready for Phase 3 batch UI
├── presets/                 # ← Enhanced display, same functionality
│   └── profiles.py          # Preset data drives hacker UI panels
├── gui/                     # ← Original Qt interface (preserved)
