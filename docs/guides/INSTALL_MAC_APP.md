## Configuration for IT Administrators

### Pre-configuring Settings

Create a preference file at `/Library/Preferences/com.footfix.imageprocessor.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" 
  "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>DefaultQuality</key>
    <integer>85</integer>
    <key>DefaultResizePercent</key>
    <integer>75</integer>
    <key>DefaultOutputDirectory</key>
    <string>/Users/Shared/FootFix Output</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Deployment Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Always test on a representative Mac before wide deployment
2. **Sign/Notarize**: For easier deployment, have the app signed with a Developer ID
3. **Document Settings**: Create a standard configuration for your organization
4. **Train Users**: Provide the User Guide and conduct training sessions

## Security Considerations

### Code Signing
- FootFix should be signed with a valid Developer ID certificate
- Unsigned versions will trigger Gatekeeper warnings

### Permissions
FootFix requires these permissions:
- Read access to image files
- Write access to output directories
- No admin privileges needed for normal operation

### Privacy
FootFix does not:
- Collect user data
- Send images to external servers
- Require internet connection
- Access system files

## Getting Help

If you encounter installation issues:

1. Check the system requirements
2. Ensure you have sufficient disk space
3. Try downloading the DMG again
4. Contact your IT administrator
5. Check for known issues in the release notes
