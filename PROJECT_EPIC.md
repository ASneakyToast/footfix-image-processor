# FootFix - Image Processing Application
## PROJECT EPIC

---

## Executive Summary

FootFix is a Python-based desktop application designed to streamline image optimization workflows for editorial teams and content creators. Named as a parody of HandBrake video processing software, FootFix addresses the critical business problem of image optimization for web content, targeting users who lack access to or expertise with professional image editing software like Photoshop.

The application will automate the manual process of resizing and compressing images for web use, enabling editorial teams to process 6-30 images efficiently while maintaining quality standards. The primary goal is to reduce friction in content creation workflows, allowing editors to focus on storytelling rather than technical image processing tasks.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- Eliminate manual Photoshop workflows for web image optimization
- Enable batch processing of 6-30 images per story/gallery
- Provide preset profiles for common use cases (Editorial Web, Social Media, Email)
- Deliver intuitive interface for non-technical users
- Achieve significant time savings in content production workflows

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

**R1: Performance Issues with Large Batches**
- **Risk**: Processing 30 large images (15MB each) may cause memory issues or long processing times
- **Impact**: High - Core use case failure
- **Mitigation**: Implement streaming processing, memory management, and progress indicators
- **Contingency**: Add batch size limits and memory usage monitoring

**R2: PySide6 Learning Curve**
- **Risk**: Team unfamiliarity with PySide6 may slow GUI development
- **Impact**: Medium - Schedule delays
- **Mitigation**: Prototype key GUI components early, allocate learning time
- **Contingency**: Consider simpler GUI framework (Tkinter) if major issues arise

**R3: Image Quality vs. File Size Balance**
- **Risk**: Automated optimization may not match manual Photoshop quality
- **Impact**: High - User acceptance failure
- **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with real editorial content, quality comparison tools
- **Contingency**: Implement manual quality override controls

### Medium Priority Risks

**R4: Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- **Risk**: macOS-specific development may limit future expansion
- **Impact**: Medium - Future scalability
- **Mitigation**: Use cross-platform frameworks and avoid OS-specific APIs
- **Contingency**: Plan Windows/Linux versions for future phases

**R5: File Format Edge Cases**
- **Risk**: Unusual TIFF variants or corrupted files may cause crashes
- **Impact**: Medium - Reliability concerns
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive file format testing, robust error handling
- **Contingency**: Implement file validation and graceful failure modes

### Low Priority Risks

**R6: Distribution and Installation Complexity**
- **Risk**: macOS security restrictions may complicate installation
- **Impact**: Low - Post-development issue
- **Mitigation**: Plan code signing and notarization early
- **Contingency**: Provide alternative distribution methods
